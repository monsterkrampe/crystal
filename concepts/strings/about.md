# Strings

Crystal has a type known as [`String`][strings] which is used to represent text.
Crystal strings are sequences of unicode characters.
Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.
This means that every time you do a modification on a string a new string is created, thereby the original string is not modified.

To define a string you can use double quotes `"`.

```crystal
"Hello World"
```

## Concatenation

To concatenate two strings you can use the `+` operator.
The `+` operator will return a new string that is the combination of the two strings given.

```crystal
hello = "Hello"
hello + " World"
# => "Hello World"
```

## Conversation between Strings and numbers

A string can be converted to a number using the `to_i` method, which will return an integer.
Alternatively, the `to_f` method can be used to return a floating point number.
If the string can't be converted to a number then an `ArgumentError` will be raised.

```crystal
"1".to_i
# => 1

"1.0".to_f
# => 1.0

"Hello".to_i
# => ArgumentError: Invalid integer: Hello
```

An integer or floating point number can be converted to a string using the `to_s` method.

```crystal
1.to_s
# => "1"

1.0.to_s
# => "1.0"
```

## Interpolation

Interpolation is a convenient way to combine strings and embeds expressions in strings.
To interpolate a string you can use the `#` character followed by curly braces `{}` with the expression inside the braces.

```crystal
name = "World"
"Hello #{name}!"
# => "Hello World!"
```

Crystal will automatically convert the result of the expression to a string.

```crystal
"Hello #{1 + 1}!"
# => "Hello 2!"
```

## Size

When you need to know the number of characters in a string you can use the `size` method, which will return the length of the string as an integer.
The size of a string is a stored property of the string, so it doesn't have to calculate the size every time you call the method, making it very fast.

```crystal
"Hello World".size
# => 11
```

## Indexing

Indexing is when you want to get a specific character from a string.
To get a character from a string you can use familiar bracket notation.

```exercism/note
`[]` is actually implemented as a String instance method, where the index is the method argument.
```

In Crystal is the first character in a string at index 0.

```crystal
"Hello World"[0]
# => 'H'

"Hello World"[6]
# => 'W'
```

To get a character from the end of a string you can take the length of the string minus one to get the index of the last character and to get the second last character you can take the length of the string minus two and so on.
There is a shortcut for this and that is to simply use a negative index, where the last character is at index -1, the second last character is at index -2, and so on.

```crystal
name = "Hello World"
name[name.size - 1]
# => 'd'

name[-1]
# => 'd'
```

### Substring test

Crystal supports testing if a string contains a substring using indexing.
It is done by the same brackets notation, but instead of an index a substring is given.
If the substring is found in the string then the substring is returned, otherwise a `NilAssertionError` is raised.

```crystal
"Hello World"["Hello"]
# => "Hello"

"Hello World"["Goodbye"]
# => NilAssertionError
```

If instead you want a `Bool` value to indicate if the substring is found or not, then you can use the `includes?` method.

```crystal
"Hello World".includes?("Hello")
# => true

"Hello World".includes?("Goodbye")
# => false
```

## Escaping

Some characters can't be written in a string directly, instead, you have to use an escape sequence.
For example, if you want to use double quotes in a string, then you have to escape the double quotes.
To write an escape sequence you can use the `\` character followed by the character you want to escape.

These are the special characters in Crystal:

| Value    | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `\a`     | Alert                         |
| `\b`     | Backspace                     |
| `\e`     | Escape                        |
| `\f`     | Form feed                     |
| `\n`     | Line feed or newline          |
| `\r`     | Carriage return               |
| `\t`     | Horizontal tab                |
| `\v`     | Vertical tab                  |
| `\\`     | Backslash                     |
| `\'`     | Single quote                  |
| `\"`     | Double quote                  |
| `\377`   | Octal ASCII character         |
| `\xFF`   | Hexadecimal ASCII character   |
| `\uFFFF` | Hexadecimal unicode character |

```crystal
puts "Hello \"World\""
# => Hello "World"

puts "Hello \nWorld"
# => Hello
# => World
```

## Multi-line strings

To write a multi-line string you simply use the same syntax as a single-line string but make a new line for every line you want in the string.

```crystal
"Hello
World"
# => "Hello\nWorld"
```

## Unicode

[Unicode][unicode] is a standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems.
Unicode supports over 100,000 characters, including letters, punctuation, symbols, and emoji.

Since Crystal uses unicode for strings, you can for example put emojis in strings.

```crystal
"Hello 🌍"
# => "Hello 🌍"
```

Sometimes you want to use a character that is not available in for example your editor or system.
In that case, you can use the unicode escape sequence to write the character.

```crystal
"\u{1F310}"
# => "🌐"
```
