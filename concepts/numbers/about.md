# Numbers

Crystal has a type, `Number` which is the base type for all numeric types.
Inside the Number type, there are two main sub-types: [`Int`][int] and [`Float`][float].

Int is short for integer and represents whole numbers.
Int can be both negative and positive, and doesn't have a decimal point.

```crystal
1.class
# => Int32

-1.class
# => Int32
```

Float represents numbers with a decimal point.
Floats can be both negative and positive.

```crystal
10.5.class
# => Float64
```

## Converting between Int and Float

You can convert between Int and Float using the `to_i` and `to_f` methods.
When converting from Float to Int the number is rounded down.

```crystal
1.to_f
# => 1.0

1.0.to_i
# => 1

1.9.to_i
# => 1
```

## Arithmetic operators

You can use the [basic arithmetic operators][math] on Int and Float.
The operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
You can mix and match Int and Float when using these operators.

### Addition & Subtraction & Multiplication

The `+` operator is used for addition, the `-` operator is used for subtraction, and the `*` operator is used for multiplication.

| Operator | Example        |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | `4 + 6 => 10`  |
| `-`      | `15 - 10 => 5` |
| `*`      | `2 * 3 => 6`   |

### Division

Division is used to divide numbers.
The `/` operator is used for division.
The result will always be a Float.

```crystal
4 / 2
# => 2.0

4.0 / 2
# => 2.0
```

````exercism/caution
In some programming languages when dividing by zero the result will be an error.

In Crystal when dividing by zero the result will be `Infinity` or `-Infinity`.
The Only exception is when dividing zero by zero, which will result in `NaN` (Not a Number).
Infinity and NaN are special values in the Float type.

```crystal
1 / 0
# => Infinity

-1 / 0
# => -Infinity

0 / 0
# => NaN
```
````

## Integer division

Integer division is used to divide numbers and get the whole part of the result.
The result will always be rounded down to an Int.

```crystal
4.0 // 2
# => 2

4.5 // 2
# => 2
```

```exercism/caution
When dividing by zero when using integer division results in a `DivisionByZeroError`.
This is different from normal division.
```

### Modulus

Modulus is used to get the remainder of a division.
The `%` operator is used for modulus.

```crystal
5 % 2
# => 1

5.0 % 2
# => 1.0

5 % 3
# => 2
```

````exercism/caution
Dividing by zero when using modulo results in a DivisionByZeroError.
This is different from normal division.

```crystal
1 % 0
# Error: Unhandled exception: Division by 0 (DivisionByZeroError)
```
````

## Exponentiation

Exponentiation is used to raise a number to a power.
The `**` operator is used for exponentiation.
When having an operation with a Float and an Int the result will be a Float.

```crystal
2 ** 2
# => 4

2.0 ** 2
# => 4.0
```

## Rounding

The `round` method takes an optional argument which is the number of decimal places to round to.
The default number of decimal places is 0.

```crystal
1.0.round
# => 1

1.5.round
# => 2

1.234.round(2)
# => 1.23
```

### Rounding up and down

You can also round up or down to an Int by using the `ceil` and `floor` methods.
The `ceil` method rounds up and the `floor` method rounds down.

```crystal
1.0.ceil
# => 1

1.2.ceil
# => 2

1.7.floor
# => 1
```

## Priority and parentheses

Crystal allows parentheses(`()`) which can be used to group expressions.
This is useful when you want to change the order of operations.

When using multiple arithmetic operators the order of operations is the same as in mathematics, also known as [PEMDAS][pemdas].
It follows the order of parentheses(`()`), exponents(`**`), multiplication(`*`) and division(`/`), and addition(`+`) and subtraction(`-`).

```crystal
2 + 3 - 4 * 4
# => -11

(2 + 3 - 4) * 4
# => 4
```
